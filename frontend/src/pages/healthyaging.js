        <p>
          Every person – in every country in the world – should have the
          opportunity to live a long and healthy life. Yet, the environments in
          which we live can favour health or be harmful to it. Environments are
          highly influential on our behaviour, our exposure to health risks (for
          example, air pollution or violence), our access to quality health and
          social care and the opportunities that ageing brings. Healthy ageing
          is about creating the environments and opportunities that enable
          people to be and do what they value throughout their lives. Everybody
          can experience healthy ageing. Being free of disease or infirmity is
          not a requirement for healthy ageing, as many older adults have one or
          more health conditions that, when well controlled, have little
          influence on their wellbeing.

          What is functional ability and how does it relate to healthy ageing?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          WHO defines healthy ageing as “the process of developing and
          maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older
          age.” Functional ability is about having the capabilities that enable
          all people to be and do what they have reason to value. This includes
          a person’s ability to:
        </p>
        <ul typeof="circle">
          <li>1. meet their basic needs;</li>
          <li>2. learn, grow and make decisions;</li>
          <li>3. be mobile;</li>
          <li>4. build and maintain relationships and contribute to society</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Functional ability consists of the intrinsic capacity of the
          individual, relevant environmental characteristics and the interaction
          between them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Intrinsic capacity comprises all the mental and physical capacities
          that a person can draw on and includes their ability to walk, think,
          see, hear and remember. The level of intrinsic capacity is influenced
          by several factors such as the presence of diseases, injuries and
          age-related changes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Environments include the home, community and broader society, and all
          the factors within them such as the built environment, people and
          their relationships, attitudes and values, health and social policies,
          the systems that support them and the services that they implement.
          Being able to live in environments that support and maintain one’s
          intrinsic capacity and functional ability is key to healthy ageing.

        <br />
        <h2 className="fs-4 fw-bold">        What are the key considerations for healthy ageing? Diversity:
</h2><br/>
        <p>     There is
        no typical older person. Some 80-year-olds have levels of physical and
        mental capacity that compare favourably with 30-year-olds. Others of the
        same age may require extensive care and support for basic activities
        like dressing and eating. Policy should be framed to improve the
        functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care
        dependent or in between.</p><br/>

        <p>Inequity: A large proportion (approximately 75%) of the diversity in capacity and circumstance observed in older age is the result of the cumulative impact of advantage and disadvantage across people’s lives. Importantly, the relationships we have with our environments are shaped by factors such as the family we were born into, our sex, ethnicity, level of education and financial resources.</p>
